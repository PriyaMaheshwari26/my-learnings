@SpringBootApplication is a higher-level annotation that includes @EnableAutoConfiguration along with other annotations like:
@ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located
@Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes
@EnableAutoConfiguration is used specifically to enable the auto-configuration feature of Spring Boot

@SpringBootApplication-@ComponentScan+@EnableAutoConfiguration+@Configuration

@LoadBalanced: 
  Applied to a RestTemplate bean in a Spring application. It tells Spring to create a load-balanced RestTemplate, which, when making HTTP requests to a service, will distribute those requests to available service instances, rather than connecting to a single instance

@Autowired:
 Spring will automatically resolve and inject the appropriate bean at that point during the application's lifecycle
