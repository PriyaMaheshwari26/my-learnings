------SPRING FRAMEWORK------

Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental concept in the Spring Framework, a popular Java-based framework used for building enterprise-level applications. Dependency Injection is a design pattern that promotes the separation of concerns and the decoupling of components in an application, making it easier to manage and test.

In Spring, Dependency Injection is primarily achieved through two approaches: constructor-based injection and setter-based injection. Here's an overview of each:

*Constructor-Based Injection:
Constructor injection is a form of DI where the dependencies of a class are injected through its constructor. Spring container manages the instantiation of objects and provides the necessary dependencies to constructors.

public class MyService {
    private final MyRepository repository;

    public MyService(MyRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
}

In this example, MyService depends on MyRepository, and Spring will inject a MyRepository instance when creating a MyService object.

*Setter-Based Injection:
Setter injection involves providing setter methods in a class for each of its dependencies. The Spring container uses these setter methods to inject the required dependencies.
public class MyService {
    private MyRepository repository;

    public void setRepository(MyRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
}

In this case, Spring will invoke the setRepository method to set the MyRepository dependency.

To enable and configure Dependency Injection in Spring, you need to set up the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container, which manages the beans (components) and their dependencies. Here's a basic example of how to configure and use Dependency Injection in Spring:

xml
<!-- applicationContext.xml -->
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- Define beans -->
    <bean id="myRepository" class="com.example.MyRepository" />
    <bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService">
        <property name="repository" ref="myRepository" />
    </bean>
</beans>
In this XML configuration, you define beans for both MyRepository and MyService. The property element within the myService bean definition is used for setter-based dependency injection.

With Dependency Injection in place, you can use Spring's IoC container to manage object creation and the injection of dependencies, making your application more modular and easier to maintain.

*Access bean in java:
// Load the Spring context from the XML configuration file
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
	MyService myBean = (MyService) context.getBean("myService");
//use the bean
	myBean.doSomething();
